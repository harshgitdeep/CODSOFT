## Task 1 Number Game
The provided Java program is a text-based Number Guessing Game. Players need to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. They have a limited number of attempts per round. After each round, the game gives feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. Players can play multiple rounds and their score is based on the number of attempts taken. The game continues until the player chooses to stop, at which point their total rounds and score are displayed.
### To run the provided Java code for the task 1, follow these steps:

1. **Install Java Development Kit (JDK):**
   Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Oracle website or use a distribution like OpenJDK.

2. **Create a Java File:**
   Open a text editor (such as Notepad on Windows or any code editor) and copy the entire Java code you provided into a new file. Save the file with a `.java` extension, for example, `NumberGuessingGame.java`.

3. **Compile the Java Code:**
   Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the Java file. Use the following command to compile the code:
   ```bash
   javac NumberGuessingGame.java
   ```

4. **Run the Java Program:**
   After successfully compiling the code, use the following command to run the program:
   ```bash
   java NumberGuessingGame
   ```

5. **Play the Game:**
   The game will start running in the command prompt or terminal. Follow the prompts, enter your guesses, and play the Number Guessing Game.

6. **Exit the Game:**
   After you're done playing, you can exit the game by entering "no" or "n" when prompted if you want to play again.

Note: Make sure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed and properly configured on your system. If you encounter any errors, ensure that your JDK installation is correct and that you're following the compilation and execution steps accurately.

Please remember that this is a text-based game, so you'll interact with it through the command prompt or terminal rather than a graphical user interface.
